(setf (documentation 'export-url 'function)

      "HTTP:EXPORT-URL is the primary method that exports URLS to make them
accessible via the http server. URL is either a string or an interned URL to
be exported.  EXPORT-TYPE is the method to use in exporting URL.


I. Basic Export Types: These involve making the contents of a file accessible via
a URL. These types require URLs that are object (i.e., have a name and extension).

        :HTML-FILE (&key pathname)
        :TEXT-FILE (&key pathname)
        :RTF-FILE (&key pathname)

        :GIF-IMAGE (&key pathname)
        :JPEG-IMAGE (&key pathname)
        :X-BITMAP-IMAGE (&key pathname)
        :PICT-IMAGE (&key pathname)
        :TIFF-IMAGE (&key pathname)

        :BASIC-AUDIO (&key pathname)
        :AIFF-AUDIO (&key pathname)
        :WAV-AUDIO (&key pathname)

        :MPEG-VIDEO (&key pathname)
        :QUICKTIME-VIDEO (&key pathname)

        :VRML-WORLD (&key pathname)

        :DIRECTORY (&key pathname immediate-export recache recursive-p)
        :HTML-DIRECTORY (&key pathname immediate-export recache recursive-p)
        :TEXT-DIRECTORY (&key pathname immediate-export recache recursive-p)
        :LISP-DIRECTORY (&key pathname immediate-export recache recursive-p)
        :IMAGE-DIRECTORY (&key pathname immediate-export recache recursive-p)
        :AUDIO-DIRECTORY (&key pathname immediate-export recache recursive-p)
        :VIDEO-DIRECTORY (&key pathname immediate-export recache recursive-p)
        :WORLD-DIRECTORY (&key pathname immediate-export recache recursive-p)
        :APPLICATION-DIRECTORY (&key pathname immediate-export recache recursive-p)

:DIRECTORY exports all files whose resource type is known.
Others export a specific content type, and ignore other file types.
When recursive-p is non-null, all subdirectories are also exported.
Otherwise, subdirectories are ignored.

When *AUTO-EXPORT* is non-null, new files are automatically exported when they
are scoped by one of these directory export types. Auto-export occurs on
demand for the GET and HEAD methods. If *AUTO-EXPORT* is :ON-DEMAND,
files are exported when they are first requested rather than at the
time the directory is exported. When exporting a directory, a non-null
argument to :IMMEDIATE-EXPORT overrides lazy directory exporting. In general,
on-demand directory exports trade faster server start up for a slightly slower
first access to a file URL within the directory. When :RECACHE is non-null,
a directory export updates the export parameters for every inferior. This
parameter forces traversal of the entire structure, like a non-null
:IMMEDIATE-EXPORT would.

A directory-style list in HTML is the default content returned for the
get method on a URL directory path. This behavior is customized by
providing a response function via the :DIRECTORY-WRITER keyword.  This
response function is called with the arguments (URL STREAM) and must
return non-null when it handles the response. If it declines to handle
the response, it may return NIL, and the standard method will list the
directory as usual. HTTP:WRITE-INDEXED-DIRECTORY-LISTING is a directory
writer that will serve the contents of an index.html file found in
the directory. Other computed returns are possible.

Note that the presence in file or directory names of escaped characters 
(see *ESCAPED-CHARACTERS*) will lead to inconsistent results, and possibly
errors. Space and question mark are examples.

        :PDF-FILE  (&key pathname)
        :POSTSCRIPT-FILE (&key pathname)

        :BINHEX-FILE (&key pathname)
        :STUFFIT-FILE  (&key pathname)
        :COMPRESSED-FILE (&key pathname)
        :MAC-BINARY-FILE (&key pathname)

        :WORD-FILE  (&key pathname)
        :POWER-POINT-FILE (&key pathname)
        :EXCEL-FILE  (&key pathname)

The following export types support inline plug-ins on the client side.
Plug-ins can be referenced using NS2.0:WITH-EMBEDDED-SCRIPT

        Inline speech synthesis is available using a macintalk plug-in
        from http://www.mvpsolutions.com/PlugInSite/Talker.html

        :TALK-AUDIO (&key pathname)

The Java language provides applets that execute on the client.  This kind of
mobile code is supported with the following export types and the HMTL
generation macro WITH-JAVA-APPLET.
        
        :JAVA-FILE (&key pathname)
        :JAVA-BINARY (&key pathname)
        :JAVA-SCRIPT-FILE (&key pathname)

:JAVA-FILE exports the source code whereas :JAVA-BINARY provides the byte
compiled binary to the client running the applet. :JAVA-SCRIPT-FILE exports
the browser scripting language, JavaScript, which is simpler and easier to use
than Java itself.

II. Redirect Export Types: These export types inform the client to
look elsewhere for a URL.  They work for the GET and HEAD operations.
The exported URL can be either an HTTP object or an HTTP path.

        :REDIRECT (&key alternate-urls pathname)
        :TEMPORARY-REDIRECT (&key alternate-urls pathname)

Alternatively, a computed response may call REDIRECT-REQUEST to issue a
redirect rather than serving content itself.

III. Search Export Types: these involve performing searches using the search
index or map search facilities in HTTP. Search URLs must end with ? so that
the system can composed the right combination of classes. In all cases, the
response function must compute the answer and return HTML over the http stream
to the client.

General Purpose Searches

        :SEARCH (&key response-function search-parser search-database)

        This exports a URL that performs searches by calling RESPONSE-FUNCTION with
        the arguments URL and STREAM. The search database and search parameters are
        cached on the URL and accessible via URL:SEARCH-DATABASE and URL:SEARCH-KEYS.

        The optional export argument SEARCH-PARSER is the parser that obtains URL:SEARCH-KEYS
        from the suffix of a search URL. Several parsers are predefined:

                URL:STANDARD-PARSE-SEARCH-INFO: This standard parser for
                search URLs. It tests whether the search info encodes form or
                list data and calls the appropriate of the next two parsers.

                URL:PARSE-SEARCH-INFO: This normal parser for search URLs
                produces a list of search parameters using + as the delimiter.

                URL:PARSE-SEARCH-INFO-AS-QUERY-ALIST: This parser for URL
                encoded form values returns an alist just like posting a form
                would. This parser should be used when an HTML form is
                returned to a search URL.  However, this method of returning
                form values is limited to 1024 characters total in the URL,
                and therefore, it's use in new code is deprecated.

        Users may provide other specialized parsers. They should accept
        the arguments (url-string start end) and need not located the ?
        suffix delimiter.

        The export argument, SEARCH-WRITER, allows a URL to specialize how the
        parsed presentation on URL:SEARCH-KEYS is written. Several writers are
        predefined.

                URL:STANDARD-WRITE-SEARCH-INFO: This standard writer for
                search URLs. It tests whether the search info encodes form or
                list data and calls the appropriate of the next two writers.

                URL:WRITE-SEARCH-INFO: This normal writer for search URLs
                produces a list of search parameters using + as the delimiter.

                URL:WRITE-SEARCH-INFO-AS-QUERY-ALIST: This writer for URL
                encoded form values that prints alist values as name value pairs
                using the urlencoding syntax.
 
Image Searches

   Image Maps

        :IMAGE-MAP (&key pathname export-type map-format map-pathname
                         search-parser search-writer)

        This exports the image in PATHNAME as IMAGE-EXPORT-TYPE and
        establishes a response function based on the image map in MAP-PATHNAME
        whose MAP-FORMAT is either :CERN or :NCSA. EXPORT-TYPE is the
        appropriate image search export type (see below).

   Direct Searches

        These provide direct control over the response function for image searches.

        :GIF-IMAGE (&key pathname response-function search-database
                         search-parser search-writer)
        :JPEG-IMAGE (&key pathname response-function search-database
                          search-parser search-writer)
        :PNG-IMAGE (&key pathname response-function search-database
                         search-parser search-writer)
        :X-BITMAP-IMAGE (&key pathname response-function search-database
                              search-parser search-writer)
        :PICT-IMAGE (&key pathname response-function search-database)
                          search-parser search-writer)
        :TIFF-IMAGE (&key pathname response-function search-database
                          search-parser search-writer)

        These export types allow the client's user to click on images and
        invoke a response from the server.  These URL are both objects and
        searchable.  When they are requested without the ? suffix, the
        contents of their associate image file is returned.  When the ? suffix
        appears, their RESPONSE-FUNCTION is called on the arguments URL and
        STREAM. See the macro HTTP:WITH-IMAGE-COORDINATES automatically binds
        the X and Y coordinates.

III Computed Export Types: These compute responses returned to clients.

        :COMPUTED (&key response-function pathname) RESPONSE-FUNCTION is
        called with the arguments URL and STREAM and is responsible for
        returning HTML to the client. :COMPUTED has an optional pathname
        so that the computation may reference a file, if necessary.
        
        :HTML-FORM (&key response-function pathname server) :HTML-FORM returns
        the contents of PATHNAME when it is requested via GET.  When there is
        a POST, its RESPONSE-FUNCTION is called with URL, STREAM, and
        FORM-ALIST.  FORM-ALIST is an alist of (QUERY RAW-VALUE) for all the
        queries in the form that the client returns. QUERY is a keyword.  When
        a client returns multiple raw-values for a QUERY, these are aggregated
        into a list of the values associated with the query in a single,
        order-preserving entry.

        :COMPUTED-FORM (&key form-function response-function server)
        :COMPUTED-FORM is a cross between :COMPUTED and :HTML-FORM
        that provides FORM-FUNCTION to generate html just like :COMPUTED
        and RESPONSE-FUNCTION to handle the post method when form values
        are returned. FORM-FUNCTION is called with the arguments URL and STREAM
        and is responsible for returning HTML to the client. response-function
        takes the same arguments as :HTML-FORM.

        :SCRIPT (&key script) Script is a client-side script defined with
        NS2.0:DEFINE-SCRIPT. These scripts may merely deliver a static copy
        of the client-side script, or they may perform a computation that
        emits an appropriate script.

        :SHTML-FILE (&key pathname) This is a computed response that
        is inserted in a static HTML file containing server-parsed HTML. When
        an SHTML element is found by the server, it inserts the result of a
        computation in place of the SHTML element.  SHTML elements are
        delimted by <!--# and --> and look like:

                <!--#include file=\"insert.text\"-->

        INCLUDE is an SHTML operation that requires a FILE. For security
        reasons, FILE must be in the same directory as the STHML file. Access
        may be controlled by providing the optional SUBNETS parameter, which
        is a comma-separated string of IP addresses without whitespace.

         <!--#include file=\"insert.text\" subnets=\"128.52.0.0,18.21.0.0\"-->
        
        EVAL is a more general SHTML operation that requires an ACTION
        parameter. ACTION is a string denoting an SHTML action. Specific
        parameters may be required by individual actions. Here, DATE-TIME
        is the operation and FORMAT is a parameter.

              <!--#eval action=\"date-time\" format=\"iso\"-->

        Predefined actions are documented by HTTP:SHOW-SHTML-ACTIONS. New
        SHTML actions are defined with HTTP:DEFINE-SHTML-ACTION. Files with
        the extention SHTML are autoexported by HTML directory export types.

IV. Export Parameters and Issues

1. Portable Exports: The #u reader macro merges a partial URL specification
against the default for the local host. Use this when you be able to load the
same exports file on different hosts. The #u reader macro has an extended syntax
that allows you to overview the default host and port specified by
the server configuration. The syntax is 

     #u(url-string :host host-string :port port-number)

URL-STRING is a relative URI. HOST-STRING is the domain name or
IP string for the host. PORT-NUMBER is an integer.


2. Subnet Security: secure-subnets are a list of IP addresses, where
0 is a wildcard. 128.52.0.0 matches all the subnets at the AI lab.

     DEFINE-SECURE-SUBNETS restricts access globally to the server.

     :SECURE-SUBNETS allows access to be specified at the level of
     URLs as they are exported.

3. Expiration: The expiration time for a url is issued as an EXPIRES header so
that proxy servers can determine when they need to refresh their cache.

Expiration is controlled by providing the :EXPIRATION when exporting any URL.
If expiration is not provided, the default is no expiration date.

The :EXPIRATION keyword takes one argument, which is either keyword or a list
of (keyword &rest arguments).

     Arguments                       Meaning

 :NO-EXPIRATION-HEADER        --  No EXPIREs header is issued.
 :NEVER                       --  EXPIRES header indicates one year from now.
 (:INTERVAL <universal-time>) --  EXPIRES header indicates now + <universal-time>.
 (:TIME <universal-time>)     --  EXPIRES header indicates an <universal-time>.
 (:FUNCTION <function-spec>)  --  EXPIRES header indicates universal time computed by
                                  applying <function-spec> to URL.  <function-spec>
                                  should return a universal for use in the EXPIRES header
                                  or NIL, in which case no EXPIRES header is issued.

4. Character Sets: The :CHARACTER-SET keyword allows any URLs whose content
type is TEXT (e.g., text/plain, text/html) to be exported with character sets
other than the HTTP default :ISO-8859-1, or subsets. The valid character sets
for HTTP are:  :US-ASCII, :ISO-8859-1, :ISO-8859-2, :ISO-8859-3, :ISO-8859-4,
:ISO-8859-5, :ISO-8859-6, :ISO-8859-7, :ISO-8859-8, :ISO-8859-9, :ISO-2022-JP,
:ISO-2022-JP, :ISO-2022-KR, :UNICODE-1-1, :UNICODE-2-2-UTF-7,
:UNICODE-2-2-UTF-7.  Whenever TEXT content types use a character set other
than :ISO-8859-1, the HTTP requires explicit specification via this export
keyword.

6. Languages:  The :LANGUAGE keyword may be supplied for any exported
URL. The value is a sequence of keywords denoting the language(s) in which the
resource is written. HTTP 1.1 defines these keywords in section 3.10 to
conform with RFC 1766. They can be a two-letter ISO 639 language abbreviation,
optionally with a two-letter ISO 3166 country code as a subtag.

7. Documentation: Keywords and a descriptive string can be attached to URLs at
export time.  For directory exports, note that these arguments apply to ALL
URLs exported during the directory walk.

     :KEYWORDS                  A list of keywords.
     :DOCUMENTATION             A string describing the URL.


8. Virtual Hosts: HTTP 1.1 requires a virtual hosting facility,
which this server implements. You can define a virtual host (or
vanity name) that will be served by the physical server from
the same IP address. Any URIs served by a virtual host must be
exported by specifying the absolute URI, including host and port
number.  The #u reader macro may be useful here.  The following
operators are available for use with virtual hosts:

     ADD-VIRTUAL-HOST: Adds a virtual host on a virtual port and
                       and makes URLs served by that host available
                       to HTTP 1.1 or greater clients.

     REMOVE-VIRTUAL-HOST: Makes the virtual host unavailable, but does
                          does not remove any URLs it exports.

9. New static export types for data stored in files can be defined with
DEFINE-URL-EXPORT-TYPE.

10. HTTP 1.1 Cache Control: The keywords below may be supplied when exporting
any URL in order to statically control how downstream proxies and caches
handle the content associated with a URL.

        :PUBLIC -- If the value is T, the entire message is cachable by any
        cache even if it would not normally be cached.

        :PRIVATE -- If the value is T, the entire message is intended for a
        single user and must not be cached by a shared cache. If the value is
        a list of keywords denoting specific header, then only these headers
        should be considered private.

        :NO-CACHE -- If the value is T, the entire message must not be cached
        by any cache along the request chain.  If the value is a list of
        keywords denoting specific headers, then only these headers should be
        discarded before caching.

        :NO-STORE -- If the value is T, the entire message must not be stored
        in any non-volatile storage by any cache along the request chain.

        :MAX-AGE -- The value is the number of seconds for which the response
        is valid, after which it should be revalidated.  This directive
        overrides the expiration header, thus allowing HTTP 1.1 server to
        provide a longer expiration time to HTTP 1.1 servers and proxies.
        This defaults to a value derived from the expiration time.

        :MUST-REVALIDATE -- If the value is T, caches and proxies must not
        serve the resource without revalidating it once it becomes stale, even
        if configured to operate with state data. Servers should send this
        directive if and only if failure to revalidate will result in
        incorrect operation. Recipients must not take any automated action
        that violates this directive.

        :PROXY-REVALIDATE -- If the value is T, this directive is the same as
        :MUST-REVALIDATE except that it applies only to proxies and not
        non-shared user caches. It can be used on response to an authenticated
        request to permit the user's cache to store and later return the
        response without needing to revalidate it.

        :NO-TRANSFORM -- If the value is T, caches and proxies must not change
        the body of the message or change headers describing the content.

11. Property List: The PROPERTY-LIST keyword adds a property list of
alternating keywords and value to a URL.  These properties can be read
and set via GET-VALUE.")
