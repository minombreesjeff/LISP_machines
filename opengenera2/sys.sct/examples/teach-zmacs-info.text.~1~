USING THE TEACH ZMACS ONLINE TUTORIAL

About Teach Zmacs:

    Teach Zmacs is a tutorial that is meant to familiarize you with some of
    the basic features of the Zmacs editor.  It is really only a text file
    that is loaded into the editor plus a few special commands to enable
    you to move around in the file.
    
    This whole tutorial is based on the idea that the best way to learn
    something is by doing it.  As you read through the tutorial you are
    given the opportunity to try any of the commands that are described.  To
    get the most benefit from Teach Zmacs you should try all the examples.
    
    Teach Zmacs is separated into sections that are in a specific order.  If
    you are already familiar with the material covered in one section you
    may want to skip over it and move to the next section.
    
    To move to the next section press the TRIANGLE key.
    To move to the previous section press the SQUARE key.
