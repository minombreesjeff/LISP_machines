D,#TD1PsT[Begin using 006 escapes](1 0 (NIL 0) (NIL :ITALIC NIL) "CPTFONTI");;; Saving

;;; Heuristic to improve on section history linkage.
;;; When the buffer is reverted, all the sections are marked with their section-id's
;;; as recorded in the file.  If the user is careful in her use of Kill Section and 
;;; related commands, she can preserve the linkage between the text in the parent
;;; version and the text in the buffer.  However, there are lots of possible ways to 
;;; mis-edit the file that wind up with a section of the buffer containing text which
;;; is unrelated to its corresponding file section, but which is related to some other
;;; file section.   This next method improves on that situation by using function spec
;;; / definition-type information to cross-correlate the old to the new.
;;;
;;; The basic policy of this heuristic is this:
;;;
;;;(2 0 (NIL 0) (NIL :BOLD :LARGE) "MEDFNTB")  The First Definition of a Hard Section Determines its Identity
1;;;
;;; If the user puts two definitions in a section, only the first one is used
;;; in trying to make sure that the section is correctly correlated with history.
;;;
;;; The plan is this:
;;;
;;; 1) create a bitmap of all of the section in the original version,
;;;    and a bitmap of all of the sections in the buffer.
;;; 2) Scan the section version nodes, picking up the function spec / definition type
;;;    for their first definition.  Note those that have EQUAL (dtype.fspec)'s with
;;;    their parent in the bitmap as used up.
;;; 3) If any sections in the buffer are left uncorrelated (as there certainly will
;;;    by if any are :new), check them against sections in the original version that
;;;    are not yet accounted for.  Try the deleted ones first.  If any matches are found,
;;;    mark the section version nodes as having a section-id. Any section that is not
;;;    :NEW, failed to match function spec with the original version, but does not match
;;;    any other available section, will stay with the original, unless something else
;;;    took it, in which case it becomes :new.
;;;--- This may want to be smart about commented-in/commented-out at a later time.
;;;
;;; Note that section 0 is exempt from all of this.
