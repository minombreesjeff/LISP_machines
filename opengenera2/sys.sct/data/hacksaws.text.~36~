The function time:parse-universal-time accepts many
fascinating variations of time specifications.  For
example:
  (time:parse-universal-time "ten minutes from now")
  (time:parse-universal-time "my birthday")
(The second example works if your birthday is in the
namespace database.)

In Zmacs, m-X Edit Zmacs Command finds the source for any
Zmacs command.

Set Screen Options customizes many status line features.
But not all!  To remove the square brackets around the
time in the status line:
  (setq tv:*wholine-clock-delimiters* nil) 

Compiled Lisp runs much faster than interpreted Lisp and
is just as easy to debug.  Always compile your buffers.

When writing Lisp code, be careful not to modify quoted
list structure with rplaca, rplacd, or setf.  That quoted
list structure is a permanent part of your program;
changing it will permanently change your program and might
even cause an error.

Use copy-list or copy-tree to make a new copy of the
list before modifying it.

In Document Examiner, use the Show Candidates command just
as you would look in the index of a book.

Wishing for new functionality?  Explore screens with your
mouse, watching for mouse-sensitive boxes.  Keep an eye on
the mouse documentation line.  You may be surprised.

Programs (or init files) can "execute" CP commands by using
cp:execute-command.  For example:
  (cp:execute-command "Show file" "P:>project>plans.text")

For any command processor command, m-COMPLETE brings up a
form with all its arguments and options to fill in.

When the cursor is on or after a function name, c-sh-A
shows the argument list for the function.

When the cursor is on or after a function name, m-sh-A
shows all the documentation for the function.

If your display is messed up, FUNCTION REFRESH
often straightens it out.

The CP command Create FEP File is useful for creating new
paging files when you are getting low on address space.

Did you know you can put keywords on Zmail messages?

In Zmacs or any dynamic window, you can click m-Left on a
definition name in order to edit it.

In Document Examiner, try Show Candidates with the word
help as an argument to find out about all the
documentation on finding help.

In Zmacs, c-m-L selects the previously selected buffer.
In Zmail, c-m-L selects the previous mail collection.
In Document Examiner, c-m-L selects the previous viewer.

c-m-sh-Y searches through your command history for
commands containing some string of characters.

Logging out reminds you if you have forgotten to save some files.

Never assume that your environment is really intact after
warm-booting.  It is most prudent to save your files and
mail, then cold-boot.

Do you like black on white or white on black for your
screen?  Use the Set Screen Options command in the CP or
try the variations on FUNCTION C (shown by FUNCTION HELP).

You can customize many Zmail settings and options.  Click
on [Profile] in the Zmail menu to explore the possibilities.

Prevent empty collections in Zmail by putting this in your
init file:
  (setq zwei:*query-before-selecting-empty-sequence* t)

Ever wondered how to type special characters?  SYMBOL-HELP
shows a chart of all of them.

Keep a FEP file of about 5000 pages called something like
extra-tank.page.  That way you always have an emergency
source of pages if you are running out of address space.

If you can remember part of a CP command name, type in the
part you remember, then press c-/ to get a list of commands
containing what you've typed.

You can resort a directory listing with various sort
parameters.  Position the mouse cursor over the listing
and click s-sh-Middle.

In a dynamic window, you can use s-S and s-R to search for
strings in the output history.

Search commands in dynamic windows can be terminated with
ABORT, END, or c-G, which all have different effects.

In a dynamic window, you can mark a region of the screen
with c-Left and then copy it to the kill ring with m-W.

Press LOCAL-B and LOCAL-D to brighten and dim your console's screen.

Press LOCAL-L and LOCAL-Q to make your console's volume louder and quieter.

LOCAL-1 LOCAL-C through LOCAL-4 LOCAL-C change the contrast on
your console.

You can customize various aspects of how your screen
looks.  Set Screen Options gives you a menu of options.

The Command Processor prompt is kept in the variable
si:*cp-prompt*.  Its value can be either a string or a
function that draws some icon.  For example:
  (setq si:*cp-prompt* 'si:arrow-prompt)

Zmail can indent the messages that you forward.  Use the
profile option called "Indent text of forwarded messages".

In the CP, command names in a help display are mouse-sensitive.
Clicking middle on a name in the display shows the documentation
for the command.

Did you see a HackSaw you liked?  The Find Hacksaw
command can find it again.  Give it a word or words that
might be in the HackSaw.  Example:  
  Find HackSaw zmacs, CP

Use the Show Hacksaw command to learn interesting hints
about using the system.

You can enable autorepeat for all keys on the keyboard:
  (setf si:*kbd-auto-repeat-enabled-p* t)
Look at its documentation for more options.

The COMPLETE key can be used to complete pathnames in commands,
even pathnames for FEP files.

You don't need to abort a command if you can't quite
remember a pathname.  Just use c-/ or c-? to ask for help.

When you're being prompted for a pathname, press c-? to
get a directory listing of everything that matches what
you've typed so far.  You can type a pathname with
wildcards (*) in it, press c-? to see what matches, and
then rubout the wildcards and type the whole pathname, or
click on what c-? typed out.

You can use tv:unexpected-select-delay and
tv:*notification-deliver-timeout* to customize
notifications by changing the time before the notification
pops up.

You can customize the appearance of the prompt strings
within CP commands.  For example:
  (setf si:*noise-string-character-style*
	(si:parse-character-style '(nil :italic nil)))

The clock in the status line can be customized in ways
beyond what Set Screen Options provides:
 tv:*wholine-clock-delimiters*:  nil  No delimiters around time
				 T    [] around the time
				 0    spaces around the time

 tv:*wholine-clock-24hour-p*:    T    24 hour time
				 nil  12 hour time

Usually, a process has to wait until its window is exposed
in order to display output on it.  You can change this
manually with FUNCTION 4 T or FUNCTION 5 T, or by using Lisp:
  (send D,#TD1PsT[Begin using 006 escapes](1 0 (NIL 0) (NIL :ITALIC NIL) "CPTFONTI")window0 :set-deexposed-typeout-action :permit)

You can create a new copy of an activity by using the
CONTROL key when you select it.  For example, to create a
new editor, press SELECT c-E.

You can debug by running code that is conditional
on the position of the mode-lock key.  For example:
  (dbg:when-mode-lock (break))

In Zmacs, m-\ closes up any whitespace surrounding the cursor.

In Zmacs, you can get smart indenting of the current line
with the TAB key.  The indenting used depends on the
editing mode.

In Zmacs, use c-TAB to get different indenting of the
current line.  It cycles through a set of plausible places
to put the beginning of the line.

In Zmacs, use LINE at the end of a line instead of RETURN
to get smart indentation while entering Lisp code.

In Zmacs, use c-m-Q to get smart indenting of whole Lisp
forms while entering code in Lisp mode.

In Zmacs, use c-m-\ to reindent regions of code or text.

Create a new Lisp form, ready for typing, using the Zmacs
command Make (), usually bound to m-(.  It creates a pair
of delimiters, ready for typing between.  It inserts the
pair of delimiters that match the command it is bound to;
m-< inserts balanced angle brackets for example.

Some word-oriented Zmacs commands (like m-C and m-J) do
their work without moving the cursor when you call them
with a negative argument.

Zmacs registers can store either buffer locations or text.
c-X S A saves the current cursor location in register A.
c-X J A jumps the cursor to the location saved in register A.

Zmacs registers can store either text or buffer locations.
c-X X A saves the region in register A.
c-X G A yanks back the saved text from register A.

In Zmacs, m-^ joins the current line to the end of the
previous one, with appropriate whitespace.

If you have trouble reading a file into Zmacs, try reading
it with m-X Find File In Fundamental Mode instead.

Using † C is a good way to explore Zmacs functionality.

You can use c-Q to insert things like CLEAR-INPUT in a Zmacs buffer.

To insert a lozenged character into a Zmacs buffer, use
the write-char function.  For example, the FUNCTION character:
  c-U m-X Evaluate into Buffer (write-char #\function)

Did you know about m-$ for correcting spelling errors in Zmacs?

Did you know about Word Abbrev Mode in Zmacs?  Its
documentation is in Document Examiner.

In Zmacs Lisp mode, you move the cursor to the beginning of a
form with c-m-U or c-m-(.  (This is the opposite of c-m-D.)

In Zmacs Lisp mode, you move the cursor down one level of
list structure with c-m-D.  (This is the opposite of c-m-U.)

In Zmacs Lisp mode, you move the cursor forward one level of
list structure with c-m-).  This is like c-m-(.

In Zmacs, you can "bring back" region marking with c-X c-X.

Press SELECT = to change SELECT key assignments.

In Zmacs two-window mode, you can scroll the "other"
(non-selected) window forward and backward with c-m-V and
c-m-sh-V.

In Zmail, you can scroll the summary window forward and
backward with c-m-V and c-m-sh-V.

In Zmacs, you can install any editor command on the key of
your choice for the current boot session.  Use the m-X Set
key command.

You can evaluate a Lisp form in a Zmacs buffer using c-sh-E.

You can compile a Lisp form in a Zmacs buffer using c-sh-C.

In Zmacs, you can protect the contents of sensitive
files using Encrypt Buffer and Decrypt Buffer.

In Zmail, you can protect sensitive messages from
unintended readers using Encrypt Message and Decrypt
Message.  Of course, you have to let the recipient know
the encryption key so they can read it!

Zmacs provides string searching for patterns.  Put the
command Extended String Search on a handy key, like c-m-S,
using the Set Key command.  Then press c-m-S HELP c-H HELP
to see how it works.

In Zmacs, m-X Edit CP Command finds the source for any CP command.

In Zmacs, m-X Occur gives you a mouse-sensitive list of all
the lines in the rest of the buffer where a string occurs.
Click on one of the lines to move the cursor to it.

The variable zwei:*mouse-click-always-selects* controls
what happens when you click left on another editor window
in Zmacs.  Some people like to set this to T so that the
cursor moves to where you clicked while selecting the window.

You can change the default mode for Zmacs buffers to Text
mode with this form in your init file:
  (setf zwei:*default-major-mode* :text)

You can change the fill column used by Auto Fill Mode in
Text Mode Zmacs buffers:
  zwei:(send (major-mode-from-keyword :text) :set-variable-value '*fill-column* 465)

You can make text mode buffers do line wrapping
automatically while you are typing:
  (setf zwei:text-mode-hook 'zwei:auto-fill-if-appropriate)

You can have your init file preload mail files so they're
waiting for you when you select Zmail in a new session.
For example:
  (zwei:preload-zmail '(:edit-mail-file 1"host:>home-dir>mail-file"0))

In Zmacs, you can point at a piece of text (such as a
word, a function name, or an expression) with the mouse
and copy it to the cursor location by clicking c-Middle.

In the CP, your typing is handled by an input editor that
uses a subset of Zmacs commands.  Use c-HELP to see the
input editor commands.

When you create a new Lisp mode buffer in Zmacs, use m-X
Update Attribute List to see the package, syntax, and base
that Zmacs will use as you edit in the buffer.

If you edit the attribute line in a file, none of the
changes takes effect in the environment until you use
m-X Reparse Attribute List.

Many Zmacs commands accept numeric arguments that alter
their behavior in some way.  You enter a numeric argument
by holding down a modifier key (CONTROL, META, SUPER, or
HYPER) while you type a number.

If you accidentally type a character at a Zmacs buffer,
and don't know whether it had been modified previously,
you can recover by pressing c-sh-U; the character(s) will
go away and if the buffer had been unmodified it will stay
that way.

In Zmacs, you can undo any commands that changed the
buffer using c-sh-U and redo them again with c-sh-R.

Useful paragraph commands in Zmacs include m-[ and m-]
(move the cursor to the beginning or end of paragraph) and
m-H (mark paragraph).

Useful marking commands in Zmacs include c-m-H (mark
definition), c-X H (mark buffer), and c-< and c-> (mark
from the cursor to the beginning or end of the buffer).

In Zmacs, the m-X Print Modifications command shows all the
lines in a buffer that have been changed.  The lines are
mouse-sensitive so you can easily move to a changed line.

In Zmacs, m-X List Changed Definitions Of Buffer shows the
names of all the definitions in the buffer that have
changed.  The names are mouse-sensitive.

Some people like regions in Zmacs marked with reverse
video instead of underlining:
  (setf zwei:*region-marking-mode* :reverse-video) 

In any application based on a dynamic window, the ESCAPE
key shows an input history for the window (mouse-sensitive,
of course!)

Zmacs keeps a history of some recent cursor locations.
c-0 c-SPACE displays that history, which is mouse-sensitive.

The Zmacs command Kill Backward Up List removes the
expression around the current one.  (Try binding it to
an unused key.)  Naturally, c-sh-U will undo the kill.

In Zmacs, you can clean up excess file versions with the
Reap command.  You can also protect specific older
versions of a file against deletion by giving them a
Dont-Reap property. (Use the $ command in m-X Dired.)

If you have a file that you want in your editor every time
you log in, your init file can automatically read it in for you:
   (zwei:load-file-into-zmacs "home:>your-name>your-notes.text")

The Zmacs commands that set buffer attributes (like the
package) normally ask if you want to change the attribute
list.  If you always want to answer "yes":
  (setf zwei:*set-attribute-updates-list* t)   ; default is :ASK

m-H marks a paragraph in Zmacs.  So m-H m-$ checks the
spelling of a paragraph.

To help track down Chaosnet routing problems try this:
  (chaos:describe-route-to 'wombat)

Zmacs keeps a buffer selection history that you can access
with c-0 c-m-L.  The buffer names are mouse-sensitive.

You can find out what day of the week a particular date
falls on, using a form like the following:
  (time:print-universal-date
    (time:parse-universal-time "January 1, 1989"))

In Zmacs, c-L with a numeric argument specifies where to
put the line with the cursor.  So c-0 c-L puts it at the
top.  Negative numbers count up from the bottom of the
window.  This interface is equivalent to using the scroll
bar to reposition the window.

In typing LMFS pathnames, you can use "<" to mean "up a level"
relative to the default.  So if the default is dv:>a>b>foo.text,
typing in <c> specifies dv:>a>c>foo.text.

Zmail can automatically mark duplicate messages as
deleted while it is processing new mail:
  (setf zwei:*insert-inbox-hooks* '(:delete-duplicates-new))

In Zmacs, c-X c-X always switches the cursor location with
the last saved cursor location ("the mark").  Because
regions use the mark, this means c-X c-X moves the cursor
to the other end of the region.

FUNCTION S selects the most recently selected window.  Use
FUNCTION HELP to see other options for FUNCTION S.

In Zmacs, you can insert multiple copies of characters
without counting because numeric arguments apply to
ordinary characters.  For example, c-2 c-0 SPACE inserts
20 spaces.

Completion saves keystrokes in many places.  See the
documentation on completion and try out the COMPLETE key
when you are typing in commands and arguments.

Command name completion works automatically (without the
COMPLETE key).  Watch what happens as you type S S M to
the Command Processor.

Even FEP commands use completion and pathname merging.

Clicking Right on a mouse-sensitive item brings up a menu
of the possible operations on the item.

Most windows keep histories of commands.  Use c-0 c-m-Y to
see the whole mouse-sensitive history.  Or use c-m-Y
followed by m-Y to bring back previous commands.

Ever use m-Y once too often, going past the item you
wanted?  You can back it up by using the minus sign
as an argument: m-- m-Y.

When you end up in the Cold Load Stream, nothing has been
lost; the window system is just confused.  Read the
proceed options carefully.  Usually they get you out of
trouble (unless the problem is due to your own program).

If Lisp stops itself, use the Show Status command in the
FEP to find out what happened.  Even when you are back in
Genera, you can find out what happened with the CP command
Show Crash Data or the Zmacs command Insert Crash Data.
This works as long as the FEP has not been reset since the
crash.

In Zmacs, the Clean Directory command deletes excess file
versions, keeping a specified number.

In Zmacs, c-U c-SPACE moves the cursor back to the last
location that is being remembered in the location history.

In Zmail, the command Add File Reference Field adds a
pathname to a message.  That pathname (called "the
referenced file") then serves as a default for
file-related commands for the person reading the message.
The names of referenced files are mouse-sensitive.

Normally your machine refuses remote-login requests when
you are already logged in.  You can enable remote-login by
using net:remote-login-on.  This means that you (or anyone
else) can now log in to your machine from a terminal or
another machine on the network.

Usually a pop-up notification disappears after 15 minutes.
You can change how long the pop-up window stays exposed.
For example:
  (setq tv:*notification-pop-down-delay*
	(* 60 (time:parse-interval-or-never "30 minutes")))

Zmacs can be smart about putting spaces around text that
you yank back.  This is particularly useful for word-oriented
editing as it keeps words from running together.  Put this
in your init file: 
  (setf zwei:*kill-interval-smarts* t)

In Zmacs, you can assign any command to a key, using the
Set Key command.

Zmacs lets you define keyboard macros, which are collections
of commands that Zmacs can replay to automate some kinds
of editing.  See the documentation on keyboard macros.

"Click left and hold" anywhere in a scroll bar scrolls
through the following screens.  "Click right and hold"
anywhere in a scroll bar scrolls through the previous
screens.  Moving the mouse changes the scrolling speed.

When you need to scroll through text in a typeout window,
it is sometimes easier to first use SUSPEND to select the
typeout window.

In the CP, sometimes you have to use TAB instead of SPACE
to finish one argument and move on to the next.  This can
happen, for example, with the Show Documentation command
when a number of topics start the same way and SPACE would
cause unwanted completion.

When the CP is prompting for keyword arguments, pressing
m-COMPLETE gets you a menu showing all of the possible
keyword arguments and their current values.

The variable *print-pretty* controls the format used for
printing Lisp expressions.  Some people find the value
:data produces more readable displays than the default :code.

You can make your own permanent custom key assignments in
Zmacs.  A form in your init file does custom key
assignments that go away on logout.  For example:
  zwei:(set-comtab-return-undo *standard-comtab*
			       '(#\c-m-S com-extended-search
				 #\c-tab com-indent-differently))

Setting tv:mouse-double-click-time to nil disables
double-clicking (shifted clicks work instead) and speeds
up system response to all mouse clicks.

Some people find it more convenient to have scroll bars on
the right than on the left.  This goes in your init file:
  (dw::set-default-scroll-bar-margin :right)

You can get any process or function to direct its output
to an editor buffer by using an editor stream.  Example:
  (zwei:with-editor-stream (somewhere :buffer-name "example" :create-p t)
    (format somewhere "Message: ~A" "Hi there"))

You can scroll the typeout window that goes with a window
without first selecting the typeout window.  c-m-SCROLL
makes the typeout window visible; c-SCROLL and c-m-SCROLL
work as SCROLL and m-SCROLL do for normal windows.

When you are very low on address space, you can run the GC
for just a few areas.  See the documentation for the command
Start GC :Immediately By Area.

In Zmacs or the input editor, completion is available
while you are typing symbol names.  Use either COMPLETE
and c-?.  This completion is available for all symbols
that are names of definitions currently in editor buffers.

In Zmacs, you can see many of the parameters that control
editing with m-X List Variables.  You can set a value for
the current session with m-X Set Variable or set it
permanently in your init file:
  (zwei:set-zwei-variable "History Menu Length" 30)

Some people find it frustrating that c-X c-F creates a new
file if it can't find the one requested.  They use this:
  (setf zwei:*find-file-not-found-is-an-error* T)
It prevents new files being created as the result of a
typo.  To create a new file, use c-U c-X c-F.
