      :BACKGROUND-INFORMATION
      "This is the old-style interface to the Hacks demos.
It collects all of the HACKS demos (Abacus, Birds, Crock, ...) into a single
menu.  The problem is that it is not particularly user-friendly.  As such, we
have separated the menu out into individual demos which each offer you instructions
and background information.  If you have problems with this version of the 
demonstration, we recommend that you just avoid it in favor of the more modern
interfaces."
      :INSTRUCTIONS
      "You will see a menu of demo names.
Select a demo by pointing with the mouse and clicking Left.
Many demos come with instructions, some do not.  (Good luck.)
If a demo doesn't tell you how to exit, here are some things
to try:
 If the demo is offering you a menu, wave the mouse off the menu.
 If the demo seems to be waiting for you to type a character,
  try pressing End or Abort.
 If the demo does not seem to be waiting for you to type a character,
  you can interrupt it with Control-Abort.
When you're done looking at all the demos you want, wave the mouse off the 
master menu to exit."
