;;; Structure definitions and other macros:

;;; A SET means a list with no duplicates.  If something is described as
;;; being a set, then it may be crucial that there are no duplicates.

;;; The fundamental data structure is a finite state machine (FSM).
;;; It has a finite number of states.  A BUCKET is a set of characters
;;; (e.g. break characters, alphabetic characters, etc).  In traversing
;;; the FSM, you are in some state, and you get a character which is a member
;;; of some bucket.  You look up the bucket in the STATE-ALIST of the current
;;; state to find the next state.  (Things are more complicated when non-deterministic
;;; FSMs are involved, but this is the general idea.)


;;; FSM-START is a set of starting states.  (The reason there can be more
;;; than one starting state is that the FSM is non-determinsitic at some
;;; points during the compilation.)  This must be a SET, i.e. a list with
;;; no duplicates.
;;; FSM-BUCKETS is the set of all buckets associated with the FSM.
;;; Buckets are described below.
;;; FSM-STATES is the set of all states in the FSM.
;;; FSM-OPTIMIZED is a flag; if T, the FSM has been optimized.
(DEFSTRUCT (FSM (:DEFAULT-POINTER FSM))
	   FSM-START			;This must be a set
	   FSM-BUCKETS			;Ditto
	   FSM-STATES			;Ditto ditto
	   FSM-OPTIMIZED		;We can save some effort this way.
	   )

;;; STATE-ACCEPTP If NIL, this is not an accept state.  Otherwise,
;;; it is an ACCEPT-TYPE symbol (such as FIXNUM, STRING, etc.)
;;; The symbol FLUSH is special to some algorithms, particularly
;;; the determinizer (q.v.).
;;; STATE-ALIST associates buckets with states; it is of the form
;;;  ((<bucket> . <SET of states>) ...)  Note that the CDR of an element
;;; is a set.  The conses of this list and the conses which are the elements
;;; of the alist are not shared with any other list, so it is OK to RPLAC any
;;; of them.  No bucket may appear more than once in the alist.
;;; STATE-FROMS is a list (which may contain duplicates) of all states
;;; whose STATE-ALIST points at this state.
;;; The next two components are used for various different things by
;;; different parts of the RTC.  STATE-MARK is usually T or NIL, to
;;; indicate that we have or have not processed this state in some way.
;;; STATE-LINK is usually some other state.

;;; Construct a new FSM that is deterministic.
;;; The STATE-LINK of each state of the new FSM is the set of old states
;;; that got merged to form this one.

;;; Start by merging all of the start states into one new state (this is ST-STATE).

;;; Next we must "process" every state of the new FSM.  One state
;;; is processed every time around the main DO loop.
;;; OSTATES is a list of already-processed states (initially NIL, we haven't
;;; processed anything.
;;; NSTATES is a list of states to be processed on later iterations (initially NIL).
;;; STATE is the state being processed.
;;; When we are done processing, put STATE onto OSTATES.  While processing,
;;; more states are created and put onto NSTATES.  When NSTATES is finally empty,
;;; we are all done.

;;; How to "process" STATE:
;;; F-STATES is the set of states of the OLD FSM that make up STATE.
;;; Iterate over all buckets in the FSM:
;;; (We want to figure out what STATE does when given a character from
;;;  BUCKET).
;;;    The inner DO-loop constructs the list A, which is the set of
;;;    all states such that one of the F-STATES goes to that state when
;;;    given a character from BUCKET.
;;;    If A is NIL, we don't go anywhere with this bucket; do nothing.
;;;    If A = F-STATES, then we go to ourself; add a transition.
;;;    If one of the OSTATES or NSTATES has A as its STATE-LINK,
;;;      then we go to that state; add a transition.
;;;    Else, make a new state, add a transition to it, and push it on NSTATES.
